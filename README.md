# Simon Says
This was a project made for my Game Programming 2B class at Wayne Memorial High School.

This was made on an Arduino Nano and breadboarded out to have 3 different buttons and an RGB LED to make simon says.

## Made with
* Arduino C Code
* Arduino Nano
* RGB LED
* Breadboard
* Male to Male jumper wires

## Setup
* Ground pin of an RGB LED connected to ground with a 220ohm resistor
* Red pin of the RGB LED connected to pin 2 of the arduino nano
* Green pin of the RGB LED connected to pin 3 of the arduino nano
* Blue pin of the RGB LED connected to pin 4 of the arduino nano
* 3 Buttons connected to pin 6, 7, and 8 of the arduino nano
* Upload the code to the arduino and it should be all set

## Usage
Pressing the reset button on the arduino nano to restart the game.

Checking the console in the arduino program can show the players score.

Follow the color instructions and you are all set
